#👋 Hey there, I’m Sudiptho

🚀 Data Engineer with a knack for turning messy data into powerful insights.
With nearly 6 years of hands-on experience, I build fast, resilient, and cloud-native data pipelines that help businesses make smarter, faster decisions.

🧩 What Gets Me Going
Crafting ETL pipelines that don’t just move data—they transform how it’s used

Designing for scale across AWS, GCP, and Azure—no cloud loyalty here, just results

Making dashboards that go beyond pretty visuals—actual, actionable BI

Diving deep into fraud signals and risk analytics—where data meets decision-making

Writing code that’s clean, tested, and built for production, not just proof-of-concept
