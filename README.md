🚀 **Data Engineer with a knack for turning messy data into powerful insights.**  
With nearly 6 years of hands-on experience, I build fast, resilient, and cloud-native data pipelines that help businesses make smarter, faster decisions.

### 🧩 What Gets Me Going

- Crafting **ETL pipelines** that don’t just move data—they transform how it’s used  
- Designing for scale across **AWS, GCP, and Azure**—no cloud loyalty here, just results  
- Making dashboards that go beyond pretty visuals—**actual, actionable BI**  
- Diving deep into **fraud signals and risk analytics**—where data meets decision-making  
- Writing code that’s clean, tested, and built for **production**, not just proof-of-concept
